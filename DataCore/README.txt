DataCore is where you add classes that define all of the different kinds of objects that store
data for the PT3Data project's models. For example, a core object would be "Player"; you'd make
Player.cs, define a class in it, and just provide public setters and getters for all the different
information that would be used in different queries that require "Player" information. See Player.cs
and PlayerStatistic.cs for a template.
